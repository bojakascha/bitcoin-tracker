# PWA Icons

To complete the PWA setup, you need to create icon files:

1. **icon-192.png** - 192x192 pixels
2. **icon-512.png** - 512x512 pixels

Place these files in the `public/` directory.

## Quick Options:

1. **Use an online icon generator:**
   - https://realfavicongenerator.net/
   - https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
   
2. **Create a simple Bitcoin-themed icon:**
   - Use a Bitcoin logo or ₿ symbol
   - Yellow/orange color scheme to match the app theme
   - Ensure it works on both light and dark backgrounds

3. **Temporary solution:**
   - You can use any 192x192 and 512x512 PNG images as placeholders
   - The app will work without icons, but users won't see an icon when installing

## Icon Requirements:
- Format: PNG
- Sizes: 192x192 and 512x512 pixels
- Purpose: Should look good on home screens
- Background: Should work on both light and dark backgrounds (or use transparent background)
